<!-- Greeting -->
# Hey there! :wave::smiley:

<!--Introduction -->
I'm Diya Biju! I'm a **Full-Stack Engineer**, with over 3 years of work experience. As a software developer at **Digital Innovation Group (DigIng) at ASU**, I collaborated with researchers and faculty to create and maintain Giles and Citesphere, open-source digital humanities research projects using technologies **Java, and Spring**.

I am a recent **Master's in Computer Science graduate from ASU**, where I learned advanced topics in software architecture, design patterns, and spring framework. I have earned two certifications from LinkedIn in these areas, demonstrating my proficiency and interest. I have over three years of prior experience as a **senior software engineer at Freshworks**, where I developed and optimized several web applications for different domains and clients, resulting in improved user experience and conversion rates. I am passionate about developing innovative and scalable solutions that address real-world problems and enhance user experience.
